# Autarky

A minimalist framework designed for the right mix of flexibility, speed of development and clean object oriented programming. Heavily inspired by Python's Flask, Autarky tries to find a sweet spot between microframeworks such as Silex and the full-stack, rapid development Laravel 4.

Currently a work in progress - none of the class names, method names or naming conventions should be considered stable, so use at your own risk - but if you want to help shape a new framework, please put your ideas, thoughts and concerns in the github issues!

Features include:

- Utilizes [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) for package management and autoloading
- No procedural code, everything can be wrapped in classes and callbacks
- Utilizes [Symfony's HttpFoundation](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/http_foundation/introduction.html) for easy handling of responses and requests as well as the [session](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/http_foundation/sessions.html)
- Comes with an implementation of nikic's [FastRoute](https://github.com/nikic/FastRoute), a [very performant router](http://nikic.github.io/2014/02/18/Fast-request-routing-using-regular-expressions.html)
- Comes with [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/), the most robust, extensible templating engine available in PHP
- Automatic dependency injection via typehinting in constructor parameters
- Interfaces for the router, templating engine, IoC container and config loader means you can easily swap out the default implementations with your own
- Service providers - easily add your own classes to the IoC container and configure the application in a modular fashion - makes for great package development
- Namespaced resources - shared namespace system between templates, config files and more to make it easy to split your application up or write re-usable packages
- Application-level middleware using [StackPHP](http://stackphp.com/)
- Testable - implementing HttpKernelInterface means we can utilize Symfony's BrowserKit and [DomCrawler](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dom_crawler.html) components, which makes system-level/functional testing a breeze. [Check out an example.](https://github.com/autarky/skeleton/blob/master/tests/ExampleTest.php)

The framework does not come with a database layer, mail library, cache layer, authentication service, queue services, translation service and so on. Feel free to pick whichever of these you like, write a serviceprovider for them and share them with the world.


### Creating a project

This repository contains the framework's core classes and tests. To create a new project using Autarky, I suggest using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

`composer create-project autarky/skeleton --prefer-dist /path/to/project`

This will set up a minimalist project for you to build on top of. Keep in mind that during version 0.x a lot of breaking changes will happen.
