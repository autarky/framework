# Contributing

Please open an issue for feature proposals or larger changes, but feel free to open pull requests right away for minor bugfixes or improvements. Make separate pull requests for separate changes/issues.

For your own sake, I recommend that you create a new branch for each pull request you do. Make sure that all your pull request branches are based on the branch you want your request to target (usually master or develop).

The master branch is the current minor version. Previous minor versions have their own branches. Only critical bugfixes should be applied to these branches.

The develop branch is the next minor version. New features are applied to this branch.

Please don't be offended if I don't merge a pull request :)
